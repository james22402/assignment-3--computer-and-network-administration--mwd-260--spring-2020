# Spring 2020 Computer and Network Administration — Assignment 3

* **Do not start this project until you have read these instructions carefully.**  
* **Read these instructions repeatedly until you understand, then begin your project. If something is not clear, ask.**  

## ❖・Introduction・❖
The answers to all the following questions should be included between the fenced backticks following each question. You may need to log in to the Linux systems on campus to test your answers. Recall that you can remotely connect to the Linux boxes using a variant of the command `ssh USER@user-COMPUTER.cs.hartford.edu`, where `USER` is the user you created at the beginning of the semester, and `COMPUTER` is one of `autechre`, `bauhaus`, `cappadonna`, `deftones`, `eluvium`, or `fugees`. For instance, if I wanted to log in to the `bauhaus` machine, I’d do so as follows:

```bash
ssh roy@user-bauhaus.cs.hartford.edu
```

## ❖・Questions・❖

### Question 1
Write a script that recursively copies all the files in one folder to another folder. The names of both folders should be arguments to the script. (_`12` pts_)

```bash
if [ -z "$1" ] || [ -z "$2" ]; then
  echo "Two arguments are required. <SRC> and <DEST>."
  exit 1
fi

echo "Copying files from folder $1 to $2"
cp -R $1/. $2
```

### Question 2
Write a script that checks whether a program exists on your machine. If it doesn’t, it should try to fetch the program via `apt install`. (_`12` pts_)

```bash
echo "Searching for package $1 locally..."
SEARCH="$(apt list --installed | grep $1)"
if [ -z "$SEARCH" ]; then
  echo "Package not found locally would you like to try installing it? (Y/n)"
  read SELECTION
  if [ "$SELECTION" = "y" ] || [ -z "$SELECTION" ]; then
    echo "Searching for package..."
    SEARCH="$(apt search $1)"
    if [ -z "$SEARCH" ]; then
      echo "Package $1 not found. Please try again."
      exit 1
    fi
    echo "Attempting to auto install package using given name: $1"
    sudo apt install $1 -y
    echo "Package sucessfully installed."
  fi
fi
```

### Question 3
Write a command that will create an empty file with a `.txt` extension named after the current folder. (_`12` pts_)

```bash
touch "$(pwd | grep -Po '[^/]*?$').txt"
```

### Question 4
Write a command that will recursively remove files with the `.thumbs` extension from the current folder. (_`12` pts_)

```bash
rm *.thumbs
```

### Question 5
Write a command that will recursively remove empty folders from the current folder. (_`12` pts_)

```bash
find . -type d -empty -delete
```

### Question 6
Write a script that reports every file name in a folder as two items: the filename and its extension. Each item should appear on a new line. (_`12` pts_)

```bash
```

### Question 7
Write a script that requests the user answer `y` or `n` to a prompt, and only exits when either of the two responses is entered. The user’s response should be echoed to the screen _before_ the program exits. (_`28` pts_)

```bash
SELECTION=""
while [[ $SELECTION != "y" ]] && [[ $SELECTION != "n" ]]; do
  echo "Please make a selection! (y/n)"
  read SELECTION
  echo "You entered: $SELECTION"
done
exit 0
```
